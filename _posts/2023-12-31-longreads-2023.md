[Game Design Logs – LOSTGARDEN](https://lostgarden.home.blog/2011/05/03/game-design-logs/)

> Great game development is actively harmed by this assumption.  Pre-allocating resources at an early stage interrupts the exploratory iteration needed to find the fun in a game. A written plan that stretches months into the future is like a stake through the heart of a good game process. Instead of quickly pivoting to amplify a delightful opportunity found during play testing, you end up blindly barreling towards completion on a some ineffectual paper fantasy.

[A Skeleton Key to Ali Smith's Artful — The Airship](http://airshipdaily.com/blog/a-skeleton-key-to-ali-smiths-artful), from the [Wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20140512024536/http://airshipdaily.com/blog/a-skeleton-key-to-ali-smiths-artful)

>The most beautiful thing about Ali Smith’s book Artful — at once a series of real-life Oxford lectures and a metafictional post-love story — is the way she carries us through her unnamed narrator's emotional progression

>Leaked internal document claims open-source will outcompete Google and OpenAI
>the uncomfortable truth is, we aren’t positioned to win this arms race and neither is OpenAI. While we’ve been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch.

[Development notes from xkcd's Gravity and Escape Speed](https://chromakode.com/post/xkcd-gravity-escape-speed/) #gamedev

> Escape Seed is a large space exploration game created and drawn by Randall Munroe. 
> 
> This was one of the most ambitious — and most delayed — April Fools comics we’ve ever shipped. The art, physics, story, game logic, and render performance all needed to work together to pull this off. We decided to take the time to get it right.
>
> The game is a spiritual successor to last year’s [Gravity](https://xkcd.com/2712) space exploration comic. Our goal was to deepen the game with a bigger map and more orbital mechanics challenges to play with.
